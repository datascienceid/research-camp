Research Camp is one of Data Science Indonesia's events, held by its Reserch and Development's division. Following are links to the resources for each subtopic:

1. For subtopics one and three, we will use [Indonesia Family Life Survey](https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-policy/data/FLS/IFLS/download.html) (IFLS). IFLS is a longitudinal survey which has already 5 waves. For Research Camp, we will only use IFLS 5 -- which is cross-sectional.
